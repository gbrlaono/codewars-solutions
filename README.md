# Codewars Solutions

This repository is designed to showcase my solutions for Codewars! It organizes problem solutions by programming language and difficulty level, making it easier to navigate and study.

## 🎯 About Codewars 
[Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/dashboard) is a platform that offers coding challenges known as "katas" to help developers improve their skills. Users can solve katas in various programming languages and earn ranks as they progress. Each kata is designed to test and enhance problem-solving skills, algorithmic thinking, and coding proficiency.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **Folders by Programming Language**: Each folder corresponds to a specific programming language.
  - Examples: `javascript/`, `python/`, etc.

- **Folders by Difficulty Level**: Within each programming language folder, there are subfolders for different difficulty levels on Katas, where `8-kyu` is the easiest and `1-kyu` is the most difficult.
  - Examples: `1-kyu/`, `2-kyu/`, etc.

## 🧩 Solutions

Finally, within each difficulty level folder, you'll find the files with my solutions to the katas.

Each file contains the following sections:

- **kata link**: A direct link to the exercise on Codewars so you can access the kata and solve it on your own.
- **instructions**: The original instructions for the exercise.
- **my solution**: My solution to the kata with comments detailing what I did to solve it.
- **test cases**: To verify the functionality of the solution in a console.
